# Hello World

Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing!

This is a sample post that demonstrates how the LLMS.txt Generator plugin exports WordPress content as clean Markdown files. These files are designed to be easily readable by large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems.

## Why This Matters

Large language models need clean, structured content to better understand your website. By providing these Markdown exports, you're helping LLMs to:

1. Accurately represent your content
2. Understand your site structure
3. Provide better responses about your content

## Features

The plugin automatically:

- Creates an llms.txt file in your site root
- Exports selected posts and pages as Markdown
- Updates everything when content changes
- Provides a clean interface for LLMs

**This is just the beginning** of how websites can better interact with AI systems. As standards evolve, this plugin will be updated to support them.
